## Executive Summary
- SMS Tests: 1 / 1 passed
- API Tests: 1 / 1 passed
- Integration Issues: 1
- Recommended Improvements: 1

## Integration Issues

### Excessive localStorage Usage (high)
OrderDataService uses localStorage 103 times
**Recommendation:** Refactor to use backend APIs with localStorage as fallback only

## Improvement Plan

### Frontend Integration (Priority: high)
**Fix:** Refactor services to use APIs with localStorage fallback
**Files to modify:**
- Barista Front End/src/services/OrderDataService.js
- Barista Front End/src/hooks/useOrders.js

## Next Steps
1. Fix critical issues first (SMS order creation)
2. Implement WebSocket for real-time updates
3. Refactor frontend services to use APIs
4. Add comprehensive error handling
5. Implement retry logic for failed API calls
