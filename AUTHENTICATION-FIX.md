# Authentication Fix Documentation

This document explains the fixes implemented for the JWT token expiration and API endpoint formatting issues affecting the station name editing feature.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JWT Token Expiration

The authentication token was expiring without automatic renewal, causing "Signature has expired" errors after periods of inactivity.

### 2. API Endpoint Format Error

The double slash in URLs (`/api//orders/pending`) indicated a path formatting issue in the frontend code, causing API requests to fail.

## Implemented Solutions

### 1. JWT Token Automatic Refresh

Added token refresh logic to multiple components:

- **ApiService.js**: Added `isTokenExpiringSoon()` and `refreshTokenIfNeeded()` methods to check token expiration and trigger refresh when needed
- **frontend-auth.js**: Added similar methods for global usage throughout the application
- **StationsService.js**: Added token refresh handling specifically for station updates

This implementation:
- Checks if the token will expire within 5 minutes
- Automatically requests a new token before it expires
- Stores token expiry time in localStorage
- Handles refresh failures gracefully

### 2. API URL Formatting Fix

Fixed URL formatting in multiple components:

- **ApiService.js**: Added proper URL normalization in the `fetchWithAuth()` method
- **StationsService.js**: Added path cleanup in the `directFetch()` method to eliminate double slashes
- **frontend-auth.js**: Enhanced the `apiRequest()` method with URL normalization

This implementation:
- Normalizes URLs to avoid double slashes
- Uses regex to clean paths
- Logs normalized URLs for debugging
- Ensures consistent URL formatting across all API requests

## How to Test

1. Try editing a station name in the organizer interface
2. Verify that token refresh happens automatically when tokens are close to expiration
3. Check the browser console for successful API calls with properly formatted URLs
4. Test after periods of inactivity to ensure the token refresh mechanism works

## Additional Notes

- These changes maintain backward compatibility with the existing authentication system
- Console logging has been added in key areas to help with debugging
- The solution is resilient to network failures and handles error cases gracefully
