### State Management
```javascript
// Global state for Support Interface
const SupportContext = {
  systemHealth: {
    api: 'healthy',
    database: 'healthy',
    sms: 'healthy',
    websocket: 'connected'
  },
  liveMetrics: {
    activeOrders: 0,
    avgWaitTime: 0,
    ordersPerHour: 0,
    stationLoad: {}
  },
  alerts: [],
  settings: {}
};
```

### WebSocket Events
```javascript
// Support-specific WebSocket events
socket.on('support:metric_update', (data) => {
  updateLiveMetrics(data);
});

socket.on('support:alert', (alert) => {
  handleNewAlert(alert);
});

socket.on('support:system_status', (status) => {
  updateSystemHealth(status);
});
```

### API Endpoints Needed
```
GET    /api/support/dashboard
GET    /api/support/metrics
GET    /api/support/alerts
POST   /api/support/broadcast
PUT    /api/support/system/pause
PUT    /api/support/system/resume
GET    /api/support/analytics/realtime
GET    /api/support/analytics/historical
POST   /api/support/reports/generate
GET    /api/support/logs
POST   /api/support/actions/bulk
```

## UI/UX Considerations

### Design Principles
1. **Information Density**: Show maximum useful info without clutter
2. **Real-time Updates**: Smooth animations for data changes
3. **Quick Actions**: One-click access to common operations
4. **Responsive Design**: Works on tablets for mobile monitoring
5. **Dark Mode**: Reduce eye strain during long shifts
6. **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

### Key Metrics to Display
- Orders per minute (rolling average)
- Current queue depth by station
- Average wait time (real vs. estimated)
- System resource usage
- Error rate (last hour)
- Customer satisfaction score
- Revenue tracking (if applicable)

### Alert Priority Levels
1. **Critical** (Red): System down, all stations offline
2. **High** (Orange): Station offline, high error rate
3. **Medium** (Yellow): Long queues, slow response
4. **Low** (Blue): Informational, suggestions
5. **Success** (Green): Positive milestones

## Performance Targets
- Dashboard load time: < 2 seconds
- Metric update frequency: Every 5 seconds
- WebSocket latency: < 100ms
- Alert response time: < 500ms
- Report generation: < 10 seconds

## Security Considerations
- Role-based access control (view-only vs. full control)
- Audit logging for all actions
- Encrypted WebSocket connections
- Session timeout for idle users
- Two-factor authentication for critical actions

## Success Metrics
- Reduce average order completion time by 20%
- Decrease support ticket volume by 30%
- Improve station utilization to 85%
- Achieve 99.9% system uptime
- Increase customer satisfaction scores by 15%

## Conclusion
The Support Interface will evolve from a basic monitoring tool to a comprehensive command center that empowers support staff to proactively manage and optimize the coffee ordering system. Each phase builds upon the previous, creating a powerful tool that ensures smooth operations and exceptional customer experience.
