# Coffee Cue System - Comprehensive Testing Strategy

This document outlines a comprehensive testing strategy for the Coffee Cue system, covering all interfaces and components including the Barista Interface, Organizer Interface, Display Screen, and backend services.

## 1. System Overview and Testing Scope

The Coffee Cue system consists of several key interfaces:

1. **Barista Interface** - Used by baristas to manage coffee orders
2. **Organizer Interface** - Used by event staff to manage stations and settings
3. **Display Screen** - Shows order status to customers
4. **Admin Interface** - System configuration and user management
5. **Backend API** - Provides data and services to all interfaces

Testing will cover all of these components with particular attention to:
- Cross-interface workflows and data consistency
- Authentication and authorization
- API reliability and error handling
- Real-time data synchronization
- Responsive design across devices

## 2. Testing Approach

### 2.1 Unit Testing

#### Frontend Unit Tests
- Test individual React components in isolation
- Focus on component rendering, state management, and user interactions
- Test hooks and context providers

**Key components to test:**
- `BaristaInterface.js`
- `OrganiserInterface.js`
- `DisplayScreen.js`
- `OrderDataService.js`
- `StationsService.js`
- `AuthService.js`

#### Backend Unit Tests
- Test individual API route handlers and service functions
- Focus on data processing, validation, and error handling

**Key modules to test:**
- Order management functions
- Station management functions
- Authentication middleware
- Data validation utilities

### 2.2 Integration Testing

#### Frontend-Backend Integration Tests
- Test communication between frontend services and backend APIs
- Verify correct data format and handling of responses
- Test error handling and recovery mechanisms

**Key integration points:**
- Order workflow (create → start → complete → pickup)
- Station management and assignment
- User authentication and session management
- Real-time updates to order status

#### Cross-Component Integration Tests
- Test interactions between different frontend components
- Verify data flow between components and proper state management

### 2.3 End-to-End Testing

- Test complete user workflows across all interfaces
- Verify all interfaces work together as expected
- Test on multiple browsers and devices

**Key E2E workflows:**
- Order lifecycle across Barista, Organizer, and Display interfaces
- User authentication and role-based access
- Station management and assignment
- Settings changes propagating through the system

### 2.4 Performance Testing

- Test system performance under various loads
- Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
- Verify scalability for different event sizes

**Key performance metrics:**
- API response times
- Order processing throughput
- Real-time update latency
- Database query performance

### 2.5 Security Testing

- Test authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Verify proper role-based access control
- Check for common security vulnerabilities

**Focus areas:**
- JWT token handling
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization
- API endpoint security

## 3. Test Implementation Plan

### 3.1 Frontend Testing

#### React Component Testing
```javascript
// Example test for BaristaInterface component
describe('BaristaInterface Component', () => {
  it('should display pending orders correctly', () => {
    // Setup test data
    // Render component
    // Assert component displays orders correctly
  });
  
  it('should handle starting an order correctly', () => {
    // Setup test data
    // Render component
    // Simulate user clicking "Start" button
    // Assert API call is made and UI updates
  });
});
```

#### Service Layer Testing
```javascript
// Example test for OrderDataService
describe('OrderDataService', () => {
  it('should fetch pending orders successfully', () => {
    // Mock API response
    // Call service method
    // Assert correct data processing
  });
  
  it('should handle API errors gracefully', () => {
    // Mock API error
    // Call service method
    // Assert error handling
  });
});
```

### 3.2 Backend Testing

#### API Route Testing
```python
# Example test for order API endpoints
def test_get_pending_orders():
    # Setup test data
    # Make API request
    # Assert correct response format and data
    
def test_start_order():
    # Setup test order
    # Make API request to start order
    # Assert order status changed
    # Assert correct response
```

#### Database Integration Testing
```python
# Example test for database operations
def test_order_workflow_database_updates():
    # Create test order
    # Start order and verify database update
    # Complete order and verify database update
    # Mark as picked up and verify database update
```

### 3.3 End-to-End Testing

```javascript
// Example E2E test for order workflow
describe('Order Workflow', () => {
  it('should allow full order lifecycle across interfaces', () => {
    // Login as barista
    // View pending orders
    // Start an order
    // Complete the order
    
    // Switch to Display view
    // Verify order appears in completed list
    
    // Mark order as picked up
    // Verify order disappears from display
  });
});
```
