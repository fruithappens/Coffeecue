# Organiser Interface Improvements Summary

## Problems Addressed

### 1. **Confusing Session Start Time**
- **Issue**: "Session start time" in station settings was confusing and didn't belong there
- **Solution**: Completely removed session start time controls from station settings
- **Result**: Cleaner, more intuitive station configuration

### 2. **No Inventory Management System**
- **Issue**: No way to enter or manage inventory items for events
- **Solution**: Created comprehensive inventory management system
- **Result**: Organizers can now create and categorize all event inventory

### 3. **No Station-Inventory Integration**
- **Issue**: No way to choose which inventory items are available at each station
- **Solution**: Created station inventory configuration system
- **Result**: Each station can have different available items based on event needs

## User Experience Improvements

### **For Event Organizers:**
- 🎯 **Clear Purpose**: Each tab has a specific, logical function
  - **Station Settings**: Configure physical stations
  - **Event Inventory**: Define what's available at the event
  - **Station Inventory**: Choose what each station can offer

- 📋 **Workflow Logic**: Natural progression:
  1. Set up stations
  2. Define event inventory 
  3. Configure what each station offers

- 🔧 **No More Confusion**: Removed meaningless "session start time"

### **For Baristas:**
- 🎯 **Relevant Items Only**: See only items available at their station
- 📦 **Consistent Categories**: Same category structure as organizer
- 🔄 **Automatic Updates**: New items appear without manual sync
- 📊 **Proper Stock Management**: Items have appropriate stock levels

## Technical Implementation

### **Data Structure:**
```javascript
// Event Inventory (organizer-created)
{
  "milk": [
    { id: "milk_1", name: "Oat Milk", description: "Plant-based", enabled: true }
  ],
  "coffee": [
    { id: "coffee_1", name: "Espresso", description: "Strong shot", enabled: true }
  ]
}

// Station Configuration
{
  "1": { // Station ID
    "milk": { "milk_1": true },
    "coffee": { "coffee_1": true }
  }
}

// Barista Stock (auto-generated)
{
  "milk": [
    { 
      id: "milk_1", 
      name: "Oat Milk", 
      amount: 5, 
      capacity: 5, 
      unit: "L",
      lowThreshold: 2,
      criticalThreshold: 1 
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Components Created:**
- `InventoryManagement.js` - Main inventory creation/editing
